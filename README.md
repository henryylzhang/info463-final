# Swipecycle

Welcome to the repository of [Swipecycle](https://nhvtran.github.io/info463-project/), our INFO 463 (Input and Interaction) project.

Swipecycle (pronounced as "swipe" and "-cycle," taken from "bicycle") is our redesign of [Tipckle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_Bpr2CU-dI), another text entry input technique for small screen devices.
It is specifically designed for a 38mm Apple Watch.

After 45 trials (i.e., completion of 45 phrases), Swipecycle will end, and your results will be downloaded to your computer as an .xml file.

## How to Use Swipecycle
Swipe (i.e., click and drag) in the direction that your intended teardrop points toward.
For example, to input the letter A, you must first swipe southeast and then swipe south.

To go back to the main screen (after swiping once), swipe in the direction of the empty (i.e., northwest, northeast, southwest, or southeast) teardrops.

To enter a space, click once.

To enter the phrase (and go onto the next trial), double-click.

Note: To input or enter any character, you <i>must</i> stay within the area that contains the teardrops. Otherwise, the system will not register your swipes and clicks or even misread them!

## Analyze Your Results
Download [TextTest](http://depts.washington.edu/ewrite/eval.html), and use the built-in StreamAnalyzer to analyze your results.
